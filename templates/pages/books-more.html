            development and its APIs. Moving on, you’ll take steps toward building stunning applications for Android.
            The book will show you how to set up the environment, and the difficulty level will grow steadily
            with the applications covered in the upcoming chapters.
            Later on, the book will introduce you to the Android Studio IDE, which plays an integral role
            in Android development. We’ll use Kotlin’s basic programming concepts such as functions,
            lambdas, properties, object-oriented code, safety aspects, type parameterization, testing,
            and concurrency, which will guide you through writing Kotlin code into production. We’ll also show

            You’ll explore various features of Kotlin by building three applications of varying complexity.
            For a quick start to Android development, we look at building a classic game,
            Tetris, and elaborate on object-oriented programming in Kotlin. Our next application will be
            a messenger app, a level up in terms of complexity. Before moving onto the third app, we take
            a look at data persistent methods, helping us learn about the storage and retrieval of useful applications.
            Our final app is a place reviewer: a web application that will make use
            of the Google Maps API and Place Picker.</p>
